# Face Recognition Access System

This project uses face recognition to grant access by verifying a live face against a reference image. If the face matches, it opens an HTML page indicating access is granted.

## üìÅ Files Included

* `face_match.py`: Python script that captures live video, detects faces, compares them to a reference image, and opens a webpage on a successful match.
* `l.html`: Webpage shown when access is granted.
* `aryan.jpg`: Reference image used for face comparison (you need to place this in the same directory).
* `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.

## üõ† Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`cv2`)
* `face_recognition`
* NumPy
* Web browser

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Place your reference image as `aryan.jpg` in the same directory.
2. Make sure `l.html` and `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` exist in the same directory.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python face_match.py
```

4. Allow webcam access. When a matching face is detected, the browser will open `l.html` displaying **Access Granted**.

## üìù Notes

* The system uses a 5-second delay between consecutive successful matches.
* Adjust the `tolerance` value in `compare_faces()` to make matching stricter or more lenient.
* The Haar Cascade classifier (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) is used for initial face detection before recognition.

## üîí Security

This is a demo and should not be used in high-security systems without additional safeguards (e.g., liveness detection, multi-factor authentication).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

The `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is a pre-trained model provided by OpenCV for face detection. Do not modify this file as it may affect the system's ability to detect faces.

I've made the following improvements to the README:
1. Added mention of the Haar Cascade XML file
2. Added web browser as a requirement
3. Added a note about the XML file's purpose
4. Added a warning section about not modifying the XML file
5. Improved formatting and organization
